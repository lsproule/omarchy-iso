# Omarchy ISO

This is where we build the ISO for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). It's based almost entirely on the existing archiso, but just tailored to run the Omarchy-specific archinstall process, and then automatically run the general Omarchy network installer.

## Building the image

Ensure you have `archiso` installed. Then run `./build.sh`.
